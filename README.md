# Meme-Generator
This is a meme generator web page that fetches data from the Meme API to display memes. It has a black background with a white box for displaying the meme and a "New Meme" button. The API provides a title, preview image, post link, and author for each meme.

# Installation
To use this meme generator, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Usage
Once you open the index.html file, the web page will automatically load a meme fetched from the Meme API. To generate a new meme, click the "New Meme" button. The web page will then fetch a new meme from the API and display it.

# Customization
You can customize the appearance of the meme generator by editing the style.css file. The current styles include a black background with a white box for displaying the meme, a button with a gradient background that glows on hover, and some basic styles for the headings, images, and links.
